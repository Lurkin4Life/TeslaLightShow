# TeslaLightShow
Tesla Light Shows made with xLights

Not going to include any MP3s here, don't want to deal with any legal stuff.

Refer to [Tesla's README](https://github.com/teslamotors/light-show) to understand how to play custom light shows. 
Basically you need a blank flash drive with 2 files:
 - lightshow.fseq
 - lightshow.mp3 OR lightshow.wav
